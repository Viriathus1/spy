"""
This example introduces some key concepts.

Typelifting creates a new high level type based on a lower level type. It is
purely a static typing contruct and it has zero runtime overhead. It is
declared like this:

    @typelift
    class MyNewType:
        __ll__: MyLowLevelType

Conversions are done like this (again, zero overhead):

    y = MyNewType.__lift__(x)  # lift
    y.__ll__                   # unlift


The second concept is OPERATORs. In SPy, operators are executed in two phases:
operator dispatch (which happens as "blue time") and opimpl call (which always
happens at "red time").

For example, take an operator like "a + b":

  1. We determine the static types of a and b.

  2. we create two `OpArg`s, v_a and v_b. OpArgs are abstract: they don't have
     a concrete value but only the STATIC type of the operands. Additionally,
     they carry around extra info such as where the variable has been defined,
     etc., which are useful to generate descriptive error messages.

  3. We call `operator.__ADD__(v_a, v_b)`. This returns an `OpImpl`, which
     tells SPy which function to call to compute the result of the operation

  4. Finally, we call `opimpl(a, b)`

The steps 1-3 happens at blue time and they are completely removed after
redshifting. Thus, after redshifting we are left with only fast opimpl calls.
