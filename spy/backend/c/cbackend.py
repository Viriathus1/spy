        Split the global FQNs into multiple CModule and CStructDefs, which
        will later be written to disk.

        Generally speaking, we try to create a .c file for each .spy file.

        The ultimate goal of the C backend is to emit all the FQNs which were
        created during init and redshift. In theory, we could emit all of them
        into a single .c file and call it a day.

        However, in order to make debugging and development easier, we try to
        split them in a sensible way. In particular, we group them by their
        FQN.modname.

        Note that this is only VERY loosely relaed with the content of
        W_Modules. In particular, consider this case:

            # aaa.spy
            def foo() -> i32:
                return 42

            # bbb.spy
            import aaa
            bar = foo

        At startup the VM creates a function `aaa::foo`, which is present in
        both the dict of W_Module('aaa') and W_Module('bbb').

        But in the C backend we care only about the FQN, so `foo` will be
        emitted ONLY inside "aaa.c".

        "bbb.c" does not need it at all, because "bbb.bar" is a blue variable
        and thus all the references to it has been already redshifted away
        into an FQNConst("aaa::foo").
